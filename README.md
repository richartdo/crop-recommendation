# ðŸŒ± Crop Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project uses **Machine Learning** to recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on **soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, rainfall, temperature, and humidity**.  
The model was trained and evaluated on the **[Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)**.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- Preprocessing with **Label Encoding** and **StandardScaler**  
- Multiple ML models tested (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)  
- Best-performing model saved for deployment  
- Ready for deployment with **Flask / FastAPI** + **Render**  
- Jupyter Notebook included for reproducibility
